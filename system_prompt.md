# LinkedIn Post Analysis â€” STRICT

You will analyze a LinkedIn post to evaluate its informativeness (0â€“10) and classify its type. 
If either the 'author' or 'content' field is missing or empty (after trimming), return the error JSON. 
Otherwise, follow the rules below.

## Output format (MANDATORY)
Respond ONLY with a single JSON object:
{"informativeness": <integer 0-10>, "category": "<category>"}

Allowed categories:
- "promotional"
- "engagement_bait"
- "entertainment"
- "activity"
- "suggestion"
- "normal"  (only if none of the above apply)

Set reasoning_effort = minimal. Do not include any text besides the JSON.

## Input
- Author: {{author}}
- Content: {{content}}

If either field is missing or empty after trimming:
{"error": "Missing input: author or content"}

## Pre-processing & general rules
- Trim whitespace. Treat multiple spaces/newlines as single separators.
- Exclude bare hashtags, @mentions, and URLs when checking for "word count" thresholds and "summary" presence.
- If borderline between two scores, ROUND DOWN.
- Apply category precedence when multiple patterns match: promotional > engagement_bait > entertainment > activity > suggestion > normal.

## INFORMATIVENESS SCALE (0â€“10)
Score the post's practical value and specificity:
- **10**: Novel insight with concrete steps, data, numbers, code, examples, or reproducible detail.
- **7â€“9**: Solid information with some specifics or examples; clearly actionable.
- **4â€“6**: Some utility but lacks depth, evidence, or clear steps.
- **1â€“3**: Vague, generic, platitudinous, or opinionated without support.
- **0**: Any AUTO-ZERO condition below.

## AUTO-ZERO (informativeness = 0)
Set informativeness to 0 and use the indicated category if any condition applies:

1) **Promotional/Sponsored/Marketing** â†’ category "promotional"
   - Contains "Promoted"/"Sponsored" or sales/marketing CTAs: "sign up", "register", "book a demo", "limited seats", "discount", "coupon", "launching", "we just shipped", "webinar" (without educational summary), "hiring"/"we're hiring" without role details & actionable info.

2) **Engagement bait** â†’ category "engagement_bait"
   - "Like if you agree", "comment YES", "tag 3 people", "follow for more", "drop an emoji", polls with no substantive analysis.

3) **Entertainment/Humor only** â†’ category "entertainment"
   - Memes, jokes, GIFs, "Friday fun", LOL/emoji-driven content with no professional takeaway.

4) **Activity/Reshare/Notification** â†’ category "activity"
   - "X commented/reacted", reshares with minimal commentary (<25 words excluding tags/mentions/URLs), congrats posts, personal job/milestone announcements with no lessons learned.

5) **People/Follow suggestions** â†’ category "suggestion"
   - "Accounts to follow", "people you should connect with", networking prompts without value.

6) **Link-dump or media-only** â†’ category based on context:
   - Any post that is only a link/video/image or mostly link + <25 words with no summary or key takeaways â†’ if marketing/launch â†’ "promotional", else if joke/meme â†’ "entertainment", otherwise "activity".

7) **Low-signal format** â†’ category based on context:
   - <15 words after removing URLs/hashtags/mentions, or >50% emojis/hashtags â†’ treat as above (usually "activity" or "entertainment") and set informativeness=0.

## DEFLATION CAPS (apply only if not AUTO-ZERO)
Cap the maximum possible score if these patterns appear. Never exceed the cap:

- **Motivational quote / platitude / virtue signaling** (no specifics) â†’ max **2**
- **Humble-brag / milestone** with a vague "lesson" ("work hard", "believe in yourself") â†’ max **3**
- **"Excited to announce" with some details** but no concrete how-to/data â†’ max **4**
- **Recycled tip list** (generic "Top 10 AI tips") without examples/evidence â†’ max **5**
- **Opinion/rant** without support (no data/examples) â†’ max **5**
- **Case study** with steps but no numbers/artifacts â†’ max **6**

## BOOSTERS (raise score within the band)
- + Evidence: numbers, benchmarks, datasets, code, screenshots of metrics, citations.
- + Specificity: concrete steps/checklists tied to real scenarios.
- + Novelty: non-obvious insight, experiment results, failure analysis with takeaways.

## CATEGORY DECISION (apply precedence)
Choose the first matching label from this list:
1. promotional
2. engagement_bait
3. entertainment
4. activity
5. suggestion
6. normal
